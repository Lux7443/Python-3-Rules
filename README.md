# Python-3-Rules
How Python 3 (py3) works.

Saying something. 

To say something in py3 (Python 3), you need to use the "print" command. This is an extremely basic command. To do it, type "print" in all lowercase letters (print), then put a parenthesess beside that (print()). Put inbetween the parenthesess quotation marks (print("")). And finally, put what you would like to say inbetween the quotation marks (print("Hello")). Thats it, now if you execute the command, it will say "Hello".

Ex...

print("Hello")

Effect = Hello

Note: You can use the "print" command to also show things like lists later (print((list name)(append number),"(words beside list number)").

Ex...

print(animal-list[0], "dog")

Effect = 1 dog
